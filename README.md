# honeybee_PH
 WIP - An extension for the [Honeybee](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-core) toolkit to allow for Passive House modeling and export to PHPP and WUFI-Passive

# Goal:
Add custom PHX Attributes to LBT/HB Objects within Rhino/GH. 
Currently, implemented in the [PyPH](https://github.com/PH-Tools/PyPH) package by adding all PHX related info onto the 'user_data' dict of the LBT object.
