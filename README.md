# test_LBT_PHX_Subclassing
 WIP -Testing Sublcassing of LBT Objects for PHX GH Workflow

Sandbox for testing out workflow when Subclassing LBT/HB Classes. 

# Goal:
Add custom PHX Attributes to LBT/HB Objects within Rhino/GH. 
Currently, implemented by packing all PHX related info onto the 'user_data' dict of the LBT object. 

# Trying:
Can all PHX data be added as normal attributes to the LBT/HB Objects, if those objects are subclassed?
