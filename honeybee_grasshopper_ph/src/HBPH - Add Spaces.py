"""
Add PH-Spaces to honeybee-Rooms. Spaces represent smaller units than HB-Rooms and 
can be made up of one or more individual volumes. This is useful if you are calculating 
interior net-floor-area or volume as in the Passive House models. Each Space will map to 
a single entry in the WUFI 'Ventilation Rooms' or a PHPP 'Additional Ventilation'.

    Args:
        _spaces: (list[Space]) A list of the new PH-Spaces to add to the Honeybee-Rooms.
        
        _offset_dist_: (float) Default=0.1 An optional value to offset the 'test points' being 
            used to determine the right honeybee-Room to host the space in. This value 
            will be used to move the test point 'up' (world Z) by some dimension before 
            testing if it is 'inside' the honeybee-Room. This is useful you drew your
            floor-segments directly 'on' the floor surface of the honeybee room as this 
            sometimes leads to errors when testing for 'inside'.
        
        inherit_room_names_ (bool): default=False. Set to true if you would like all of the 
            PH-Spaces 'in' a Honeybee Room to automatically inherit the display name of the 
            Honeybee Room. Note: this will override any user-defined Space names.
        
        _hb_rooms: (list[Room]) The list of honeybee-Rooms to add to the spaces to.
            
    Returns:
        check_pts_: A preview of the test points being used to evaluate the right
            honeybee-Room to use for the host of the space. Useful for debugging 
            if you run into hosting problems.
            
        hb_rooms_: The honeyee-Rooms with the PH Spaces added to them.
