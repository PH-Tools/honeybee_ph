"""
Use this component to add one or more honeybee-Rooms to a PH-Building-Segment. This 
'building-segment' could be a single floor, a 'wing' or an entire building and will 
map to a single 'Case' in WUFI or a single PHPP file.
-
Since Passive House models only allow for a single thermal zone, any honeybee-rooms 
that are part of the building-segment will be merged / joined when exported to 
WUFI-Passive or PHPP. When merged, only the exterior surfaces will be retained, and 
any faces with a 'Surface' boundary condition well be removed from the Passive House 
model. Only Honeybee Faces with boundary conditions of "Outdoors", "Ground" and 
"Adiabatic" will be included in the new Honeybee Room. 
-
Use this before passing the honeybee-rooms on to the 'HB Model' component.

    Args:
        segment_name_: Name for the building-segment
        
        occupancy_type_: Input either -
            "1-Residential" (default)
            "2-Non-residential"
        
        usage_type_: Input either -
            "1-Residential" (default)
            "4-Office/Administrative building"
            "5-School"
            "6-Other"
            "7-Undefined/unfinished"
        
        num_floor_levels_: (int) Total number of floor levels for the group of 
            Honeybee rooms input. Default=1
        
        num_dwelling_units_: (int) Total number of 'units' for the group of Honeybee rooms
            input For residential, this is the total number of dwelling units
            in the group of HB-Room. For non-residential, leave this set to "1".
        
        climate_: Optional Passive House monthly climate data.
        
        source_energy_factors_: (Optional) A list of source energy (site->source) energy 
            factors to use for assessing overall source (primary) energy usage. By default, 
            this component will use the standard Phius 2021 source energy factors which can be 
            found at https://www.phius.org/PHIUS+2021/Phius%20Core_Phius%20Zero_Final%20Modeling%20Protocol%20v1.1.pdf
            -
            Use the "Create Conversion Factor" component to define custom factors if you would 
            like to use your own. Be sure to define all of the fuel-factors required by Phius / WUFI.

        co2e_factors_: (Optional) A list of CO2e (site->CO2e) conversion 
            factors to use for assessing overall GHG emissions. By default, 
            this component will use the standard Phius 2021 CO2e factors which can be 
            found at https://www.phius.org/PHIUS+2021/Phius%20Core_Phius%20Zero_Final%20Modeling%20Protocol%20v1.1.pdf

        phius_certification_: Optional Phius certification thresholds.
        
        winter_set_temp_: default = 20C [68F]
        
        summer_set_temp_: default = 25C [77F]
    
    Returns:
        hb_rooms_: The honeyee-Rooms with building-segment information added.
