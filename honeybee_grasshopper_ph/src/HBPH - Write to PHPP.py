"""
Convert an existing HBJSON file to a Passive House Exchange (PHX) model and write out 
the model data to a PHPP document. 
NOTE:
    - You must have a valid PHPP document to write to. The PHPP is not part of the 
    honeybee-ph plugin and must be purchased from PHI or your local reseller. For more 
    information, see: "https://passivehouse.com/04_phpp/04_phpp.htm"
    - The PHPP document you would like to write to should be open alongside Rhino, 
    and must be the the 'active' excel document. To ensure best results and least 
    likelihood of conflicts, it is recommended to close all other excel documents 
    on your system except the PHPP.
    - Once the PHPP file is open, set _write to True to run the writer. 
    - IMPORTANT: This component simply writes the data to the PHPP file. Once writen, 
    be sure to save your PHPP file with the new data to the appropriate location on 
    your computer.
