"""
Apply a Honeybee SHW Mechanical System to a Honeybee Room or Rooms. Note that
this component will completely override any existing SHW System on the rooms input. If 
the room does not already have a Honeybee-Energy 'service_hot_water' load, one will 
be added with a nominal load of 0.001 L/hour.
